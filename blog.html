                    <h3>The Evolution of E-commerce</h3>
                    <p>E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, began in the late 20th century as businesses started to leverage the internet to sell products and services. The first notable milestone was the launch of Amazon in 1995, which started as an online bookstore and quickly diversified into various product categories. Around the same time, eBay emerged as a popular online auction site, further solidifying the internet's potential for commercial transactions.</p>
                    <p>The early 2000s saw the rise of online payment systems like PayPal, making transactions more secure and convenient. As technology advanced, mobile commerce (m-commerce) gained traction, with smartphones becoming ubiquitous and mobile apps offering seamless shopping experiences. Today, e-commerce encompasses a wide range of platforms, including social media marketplaces, subscription services, and even virtual reality (VR) shopping experiences.</p>
